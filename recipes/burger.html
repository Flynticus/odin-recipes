        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Imagine being at a cookout. Coolers with drinks, music playing, smoke is puffing out of the grill with the scent of delicious meats being cooked. What are you
            grabbing for your first plate? How about a delicious All American Burger!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>This is all relative, because you really just need ground beef and good ole American cheese. I will provide a list below, but feel free to customize!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5lb of ground beef (80/20 is best for maximum flavor)</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of bread crumbs</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want a more well done burger, cook for 4 minutes each side instead of 3.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on grill and set to medium heat and close the lid. Combine beef, garlic salt, black pepper, salt, and bread crumbs in a large bowl and mix thouroghly</li>
            <li>Form the beef into 4 equal size patties</li>
            <li>Place the beef patties on the now heated grill and close the lid</li>
            <li>Let the patties cook for about 3 minutes, flip the patties over, and close the lid</li>
            <li>Allow the patties to continue cooking for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>Open the lid and place 1 slice of American cheese per patty, then close the lid and turn off the grill if there are no other items to cook</li>
            <li>After 30 seconds, remove the patties from the grill and place onto your bun.</li>
            <li>Top it with your favorite condiments and enjoy!</li>
